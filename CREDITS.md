RestKit Credits
===============

RestKit was originally developed in the summer of 2009 under the name OTRestFramework
as a Ruby on Rails specific object mapper for XML data. In early 2010 the framework was
rebranded as RestKit and evolved into a general purpose HTTP toolkit and object mapping
system.

RestKit is a production of Two Toasters and available as an Open Source package under
the terms of the Apache License (see LICENSE for details).
