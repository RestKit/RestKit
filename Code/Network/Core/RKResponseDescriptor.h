/**
 An `RKResponseDescriptor` object describes an object mapping configuration that is applicable to an HTTP response. Response descriptors are defined by specifying the `RKMapping` object that is to be used when performing object mapping on the deserialized response body and the URL path pattern, key path, and status codes for which the mapping is appropriate. The path pattern is a SOCKit `SOCPattern` string that will be matched against the URL of the request that loaded the response being mapped. If the path pattern is nil, the response descriptor is considered to be appropriate for a response loaded from any URL. The key path specifies the location of data within the deserialized response body for which the mapping is appropriate. If nil, the mapping is considered to apply to the entire response body.  The status codes specify a set of HTTP response status codes for which the mapping is appropriate. It is common to constrain a response descriptor to the HTTP Successful status code class (status codes in the 200-299 range). Object mapping for error responses can be configured by configuring a response descriptor to handle the Client Error status code class (status codes in the 400-499 range). Instances of `RKResponseDescriptor` are immutable.

/**
 Returns a Boolean value that indicates if the given URL object matches the base URL and path pattern of the receiver.

 This method considers both the `baseURL` and `pathTemplateString` of the receiver when evaluating the given URL object. The results evaluate in the following ways:

 1. If the `baseURL` and `pathTemplateString` of the receiver are both `nil`, then `YES` is returned.
 1. If the `baseURL` of the receiver is `nil`, but the path pattern is not, then the entire path and query string of the given URL will be evaluated against the path pattern of the receiver using `matchesPath:`.
 1. If the `baseURL` and the `pathTemplateString` are both non-nil, then the given URL is first checked to verify that it is relative to the base URL using a string prefix comparison. If the absolute string value of the given URL is prefixed with the string value of the base URL, then the URL is considered relative. If the given URL is found not to be relative to the receiver's baseURL, then `NO` is returned. If the URL is found to be relative to the base URL, then the path and query string of the URL are evaluated against the path pattern of the receiver using `matchesPath:`.

 @param URL The URL to compare with the base URL and path pattern of the receiver.
 @return `YES` if the URL matches the base URL and path pattern of the receiver, else `NO`.
