/**
 The `RKObjectManager` class provides a centralized interface for performing object mapping based HTTP request and response operations. It encapsulates common configuration such as request/response descriptors and routing, provides for the creation of NSURLRequest and RKObjectRequestOperation objects, and one-line methods to enqueue object request operations for the basic HTTP request methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc).

 ## Request and Response Descriptors
 
 RestKit centralizes configuration for object mapping configurations into the object manager through `RKRequestDescriptor` and `RKResponseDescriptor` objects. A collection of each of these object types are maintained by the manager and used to initialize all `RKObjectRequestOperation` objects created by the manager.
 
 Request descriptors describe how `NSURLRequest` objects constructed by the manager will be built by specifying how the attributes and relationships for a given class will be object mapped to construct request parameters and what, if any, root key path the parameters will be nested under. Request descriptor objects can also be used with the `RKObjectParameterization` class to map an object into an `NSDictionary` representation that is suitable for use as the parameters of a request.
 
 Response descriptors describe how `NSHTTPURLResponse` objects loaded by object request operations sent by the manager are to be object mapped into local domain objects. Response descriptors are matched against a given response via URL path matching, parsed content key path matching, or both. The `RKMapping` object associated from a matched `RKResponseDescriptor` is given to an instance of `RKMapperOperation` with the parsed response body to perform object mapping on the response.
 
 To better illustrate these concepts, consider the following example for an imaginary Wiki client application:
 
    @interface RKWikiPage : NSObject
    @property (nonatomic, copy) NSString *title;
    @property (nonatomic, copy) NSString *body;
    @end     
 
    // Construct a request mapping for our class
    RKObjectMapping *requestMapping = [RKObjectMapping requestMapping];
    [requestMapping addAttributeMappingsFromDictionary:@{ @"title": @"title", @"body": @"body" }];
    
    // We wish to generate parameters of the format: 
    // @{ @"page": @{ @"title": @"An Example Page", @"body": @"Some example content" } }
    RKRequestDescriptor *requestDescriptor = [RKRequestDescriptor requestDescriptorWithMapping:mapping
                                                                                   objectClass:[RKWikiPage class]
                                                                                   rootKeyPath:@"page"];
 
    // Construct an object mapping for the response
    // We are expecting JSON in the format:
    // {"page": {"title": "<title value>", "body": "<body value>"}
    RKObjectMapping *responseMapping = [RKObjectMapping mappingForClass:[RKWikiPage class]];
    [responseMapping addAttributeMappingsFromArray:@[ @"title", @"body" ]];
 
    // Construct a response descriptor that matches any URL (the pathPattern is nil), when the response payload
    // contains content nested under the `@"page"` key path, if the response status code is 200 (OK)
    RKResponseDescriptor *responseDescriptor = [RKResponseDescriptor responseDescriptorWithMapping:responseMapping
                                                                                       pathPattern:nil
                                                                                           keyPath:@"page"
                                                                                       statusCodes:[NSIndexSet indexSetWithIndex:200]];
 
    // Register our descriptors with a manager
    RKObjectManager *manager = [RKObjectManager managerWithBaseURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://restkit.org/"]];
    [manager addRequestDescriptor:requestDescriptor];
    [manager addResponseDescriptor:responseDescriptor];
 
    // Work with the object
    RKWikiPage *page = [RKWikiPage new];
    page.title = @"An Example Page";
    page.body  = @"Some example content";
 
    // POST the parameterized representation of the `page` object to `/posts` and map the response
    [manager postObject:page path:@"/pages" parameters:nil success:^(RKObjectRequestOperation *operation, RKMappingResult *result) {
        NSLog(@"We object mapped the response with the following result: %@", result);
    } failure:nil];
 
 In the above example, request and response mapping configurations were described for a simple data model and then used to perform a basic POST operation and map the results. An arbitrary number of request and response descriptors may be added to the manager to accommodate your application's needs.
 
 ## Routing
 
 Routing is the process of generating an `NSURL` appropriate for a particular HTTP server request interaction. Using routing instead of hard-coding paths enables centralization of configuration and allows the developer to focus on what they want done rather than the details of how to do it. Changes to the URL structure in the application can be made in one place. Routes can also be useful in testing, as they permit for the changing of paths at run-time.
 
 Routing interfaces are provided by the `RKRouter` class. Each object manager is in initialized with an `RKRouter` object with a baseURL equal to the baseURL of the underlying `AFHTTPClient` object. Each `RKRouter` instance maintains an `RKRouteSet` object that manages a collection of `RKRoute` objects. Routes are defined in terms of a path pattern.
 
 There are three types of routes currently supported:
 
 1. Class Routes. Class routes are configured to target a given object class and HTTP request method. For example, we might route the HTTP `GET` for a `User` class to the path pattern `@"/users/:userID"`.
 1. Relationship Routes. Relationship routes identify the path appropriate for performing a request for an object that is related to another object. For example, each `User` may have many friends. This might be routed as a relationship route for the `User` class with the name `@"friends"` to the path pattern `@"/users/:userID/friends"`.
 1. Named Routes. Names routes bind an arbitrary name to a path. For example, there might be an action to follow another user that could be added as a named route with the name `@"follow_user"` that generates a `POST` to the path pattern `@"/users/:userID/follow"`.
 
 To better understand these concepts, please consider the following example code for configuring the above routing examples:
 
    RKObjectManager *manager = [RKObjectManager managerWithBaseURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://restkit.org"]];
 
    // Class Route
    [manager.router.routeSet addRoute:[RKRoute routeWithClass:[User class] pathPattern:@"/users/:userID" method:RKRequestMethodGET]];
 
    // Relationship Route
    [manager.router.routeSet addRoute:[RKRoute routeWithRelationshipName:@"friends" objectClass:[User class] pathPattern:@"/users/:userID/friends" method:RKRequestMethodGET]];
 
    // Named Route
    [manager.router.routeSet addRoute:[RKRoute routeWithName:@"follow_user" pathPattern:@"/users/:userID/follow" method:RKRequestMethodPOST]];
 
 Once configured, routes will be consulted by the object manager whenever the path parameter provided to a method is given as nil. For example, invoking the following code would result in a `GET` to the path `@"/users/1234"`:
 
    User *user = [User new];
    user.userID = 1234;
    [manager getObject:user path:nil parameters:nil success:^(RKObjectRequestOperation *operation, RKMappingResult *result) {
        // Request 
    } failure:nil];
 
 Routes can also be explicitly used to construct `NSMutableURLRequest` objects and are referenced explicitly in a few object request operation methods:
 
 1. `requestWithObject:method:path:parameters:` - Consults routing when path is nil.
 1. `multipartFormRequestWithObject:method:path:parameters:constructingBodyWithBlock:` - Consults routing when path is nil.
 1. `requestWithPathForRouteNamed:object:parameters:` - Explicitly retrieves the route with the given name.
 1. `getObjectsAtPathForRelationship:ofObject:parameters:success:failure:` - Explicitly retrieves the route for the given name and object class.
 1. `getObjectsAtPathForRouteNamed:object:parameters:success:failure:` - Explicitly retrieves the route for the given name.
 
 Please see the documentation for `RKRouter`, `RKRouteSet`, and `RKRoute` for more details about the routing classes.
 
 ## Core Data
 
 RestKit features deep integration with Apple's Core Data persistence framework. The object manager provides access to this integration by creating `RKManagedObjectRequestOperation` objects when an attempt is made to interact with a resource that has been mapped using an `RKEntityMapping`. To utilize the Core Data integration, the object manager must be provided with a fully configured `RKManagedObjectStore` object. The `RKManagedObjectStore` provides access to the `NSManagedObjectModel` and `NSManagedObjectContext` objects required to peform object mapping that targets a Core Data entity.
 
 Please see the documentation for `RKManagedObjectStore`, `RKEntityMapping`, and `RKManagedObjectRequestOperation` for in depth information about Core Data in RestKit.
