    [rq setValue:[[echo URL] absoluteString] forHTTPHeaderField:@"X-Auth-Service-Provider"];
    [rq setValue:[echo valueForHTTPHeaderField:@"Authorization"] forHTTPHeaderField:@"X-Verify-Credentials-Authorization"];
    // Now consume rq with an NSURLConnection
    [rq release];

/**
  Suggested usage would be to make some categories for this class that
  automatically adds both secrets, both tokens and host information. This

      [TwitterOAuth GET:@"/1/statuses/home_timeline.json" queryParameters:dictionary];

  At TweetDeck we have TDAccount classes that represent separate user logins
