/**
 The mapping provider is a repository of registered object mappings for use by instances
 of RKObjectManager and RKObjectMapper. It provides for the storage and retrieval of object
 mappings by keyPath and type.

 The mapping provider is responsible for:

 1. Providing instances of RKObjectMapper with keyPaths and object mappings for use
    when attempting to map a parsed payload into objects. Each keyPath is examined using
    valueForKeyPath: to determine if any mappable data exists within the payload. If data is
    found, the RKObjectMapper will instantiate an RKObjectMappingOperation to perform the mapping
    using the RKObjectMapping or RKDynamicMapping associated with the keyPath.
 1. Providing the appropriate serialization mapping to instances of RKObjectManager when an object
    is to be sent to the remote server using [RKObjectManager postObject:delegate:] or
    [RKObjectManager postObject:delegate]. This mapping is used to serialize the object into a
    format suitable for encoding into a URL form encoded or JSON representation.
 1. Providing convenient storage of RKObjectMapping references for users who are not using keyPath
    based mapping. Mappings can be added to the provider and retrieved by the [RKObjectMapping objectClass]
    that they target.

/**
 Registers an object mapping as being rooted at a specific keyPath. The keyPath will be registered
 and an inverse mapping for the object will be generated and used for serialization.

 This is a shortcut for configuring a pair of object mappings that model a simple resource the same
 way when going to and from the server.

 For example, if we have a simple resource called 'person' that returns JSON in the following
 format:

    { "person": { "first_name": "Blake", "last_name": "Watters" } }

 We might configure a mapping like so:

    RKObjectMapping *mapping = [RKObjectMapping mappingForClass:[Person class]];
    [mapping mapAttributes:@"first_name", @"last_name", nil];

 If we want to parse the above JSON and serialize it such that using postObject: or putObject: use the same format,
 we can auto-generate the serialization mapping and set the whole thing up in one shot:

    [[RKObjectManager sharedManager].mappingProvider registerMapping:mapping withRootKeyPath:@"person"];

 This will call setMapping:forKeyPath: for you, then generate a serialization mapping and set the root
 keyPath as well.

 If you want to manipulate the serialization mapping yourself, you can work with the mapping directly:

    RKObjectMapping *serializationMappingForPerson = [personMapping inverseMapping];
    // NOTE: Serialization mapping default to a nil root keyPath and will serialize to a flat dictionary
    [[RKObjectManager sharedManager].mappingProvider setSerializationMapping:serializationMappingForPerson forClass:[Person class]];

 this request with a resourcePathPattern of @"/products/:productID/reviews".
