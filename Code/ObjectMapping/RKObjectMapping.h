/**
 An object mapping defines the rules for transforming a key-value coding
 compliant object into another representation. The mapping is defined in terms
 of a source object class and a collection of rules defining how keyPaths should
 be transformed into target attributes and relationships.
 
 There are two types of transformations possible:
 
 1. keyPath to attribute. Defines that the value found at the keyPath should be
transformed and assigned to the property specified by the attribute. The transformation
to be performed is determined by inspecting the type of the target property at runtime.
 1. keyPath to relationship. Defines that the value found at the keyPath should be
transformed into another object instance and assigned to the property specified by the 
relationship. Relationships are processed using an object mapping as well.
 
 Through the use of relationship mappings, an arbitrarily complex object graph can be mapped for you.
 
 Instances of RKObjectMapping are used to configure RKObjectMappingOperation instances, which actually
 perform the mapping work. Both object loading and serialization are defined in terms of object mappings.

/**
 Forces the mapper to treat the mapped keyPath as a collection even if it does not

 a collection of objects.
 
 When enabled, each key/value pair in the resolved dictionary will be mapped as a separate
 entity. This is useful when you have a JSON structure similar to:
 
     { "users": 
        { 
            "blake": { "id": 1234, "email": "blake@restkit.org" },

        }

 By enabling forceCollectionMapping, RestKit will map "blake" => attributes and
 "rachit" => attributes as independent objects. This can be combined with
 mapKeyOfNestedDictionaryToAttribute: to properly map these sorts of structures.
