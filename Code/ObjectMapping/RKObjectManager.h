/**
 The object manager is the primary interface for interacting with RESTful resources via HTTP. It is
 responsible for retrieving remote object representations via HTTP and transforming them into local
 domain objects via the RKObjectMapper. It is also capable of serializing local objects and sending them
 to a remote system for processing. The object manager strives to hide the developer from the details of
 configuring an RKRequest, processing an RKResponse, parsing any data returned by the remote system, and
 running the parsed data through the object mapper.

 <h3>Shared Manager Instance</h3>

 Multiple instances of RKObjectManager may be used in parallel, but the first instance initialized
 is automatically configured as the sharedManager instance. The shared instance can be changed at runtime
 if so desired. See sharedManager and setSharedManager for details.

 <h3>Configuring the Object Manager</h3>

 The object mapper must be configured before object can be loaded from or transmitted to your remote backend
 system. Configuration consists of specifying the desired MIME types to be used during loads and serialization,
 registering object mappings to use for mapping and serialization, registering routes, and optionally configuring
 an instance of the managed object store (for Core Data).

 <h4>MIME Types</h4>

 MIME Types are used for two purposes within RestKit:

 1. Content Negotiation. RestKit leverages the HTTP Accept header to specify the desired representation of content
 when contacting a remote web service. You can specify the MIME Type to use via the acceptMIMEType method. The default
 MIME Type is RKMIMETypeJSON (application/json). If the remote web service responds with content in a different MIME Type
 than specified, RestKit will attempt to parse it by consulting the [parser registry][RKParserRegistry parserForMIMEType:].
 Failure to find a parser for the returned content will result in an unexpected response invocation of
 [RKObjectLoaderDelegate objectLoaderDidLoadUnexpectedResponse].
 1. Serialization. RestKit can be used to transport local object representation back to the remote web server for processing
 by serializing them into an RKRequestSerializable representation. The desired serialization format is configured by setting
 the serializationMIMEType property. RestKit currently supports serialization to RKMIMETypeFormURLEncoded and RKMIMETypeJSON.
 The serialization rules themselves are expressed via an instance of RKObjectMapping.

 <h4>The Mapping Provider</h4>

 RestKit determines how to map and serialize objects by consulting the mappingProvider. The mapping provider is responsible
 for providing instances of RKObjectMapper with object mappings that should be used for transforming mappable data into object
 representations. When you ask the object manager to load or send objects for you, the mappingProvider instance will be used
 for the object mapping operations constructed for you. In this way, the mappingProvider is the central registry for the knowledge
 about how objects in your application are mapped.

 Mappings are registered by constructing instances of RKObjectMapping and registering them with the provider:
 `
    RKObjectManager *manager = [RKObjectManager managerWithBaseURL:myBaseURL];
    RKObjectMapping *articleMapping = [RKObjectMapping mappingForClass:[Article class]];
    [mapping mapAttributes:@"title", @"body", @"publishedAt", nil];
    [manager.mappingProvider setObjectMapping:articleMapping forKeyPath:@"article"];

    // Generate an inverse mapping for transforming Article -> NSMutableDictionary.
    [manager.mappingProvider setSerializationMapping:[articleMapping inverseMapping] forClass:[Article class]];`

 <h4>Configuring Routes</h4>

 Routing is the process of transforming objects and actions (as defined by HTTP verbs) into resource paths. RestKit ships

 <h4>Initializing a Core Data Object Store</h4>
 <h3>Loading Remote Objects</h3>

 <h3>Routing &amp; Object Serialization</h3>

 <h3>Default Error Mapping</h3>
