/**
 Sent when an object loader encounters a response status code or MIME Type that RestKit does not know how to handle.

 Response codes in the 2xx, 4xx, and 5xx range are all handled as you would expect. 2xx (successful) response codes
 are considered a successful content load and object mapping will be attempted. 4xx and 5xx are interpretted as
 errors and RestKit will attempt to object map an error out of the payload (provided the MIME Type is mappable)
 and will invoke objectLoader:didFailWithError: after constructing an NSError. Any other status code is considered
 unexpected and will cause objectLoaderDidLoadUnexpectedResponse: to be invoked provided that you have provided
 an implementation in your delegate class.

 RestKit will also invoke objectLoaderDidLoadUnexpectedResponse: in the event that content is loaded, but there
 is not a parser registered to handle the MIME Type of the payload. This often happens when the remote backend
 system RestKit is talking to generates an HTML error page on failure. If your remote system returns content
 in a MIME Type other than application/json or application/xml, you must register the MIME Type and an appropriate
 parser with the [RKParserRegistry sharedParser] instance.

 Also note that in the event RestKit encounters an unexpected status code or MIME Type response an error will be
 constructed and sent to the delegate via objectLoader:didFailsWithError: unless your delegate provides an
 implementation of objectLoaderDidLoadUnexpectedResponse:. It is recommended that you provide an implementation
 and attempt to handle common unexpected MIME types (particularly text/html and text/plain).

 Note that the mappable data is a pointer to a pointer to allow you to replace the mappable data
 with a new object to be mapped. You must dereference it to access the value.
