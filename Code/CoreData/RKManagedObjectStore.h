/**
 THe RKManagedObjectStore class encapsulates a Core Data stack including a
 managed object model, a persistent store coordinator, and a set of managed
 object contexts. The managed object store simplifies the task of properly 
 setting up a Core Data stack and provides some additional functionality, such
 as the use of a seed database to initialize a SQLite backed persistent store and
 a simple code path for resetting the store by destroying and recreating the persistent
 stores.
 
 ## Initialization
 
 The managed object store is designed to easily initialize a Core Data stack in a recommended
 configuration. A store object must always be initialized with a managed object model, but this
 managed object model can be directly provided, inferred from an already configured persistent
 store coordinator, or read from the currently available bundles within the application. Note
 that several features provided by the framework rely on the store being initialized with a mutable
 managed object model. Please refer to the documentation in the initWithManagedObjectModel: for details.
 
 ## Managed Object Contexts
 
 The managed object store provides the application developer with a pair of managed
 objects with which to work with Core Data. The store configures a primary managed object
 context with the NSPrivateQueueConcurrencyType that is associated with the 
 persistent store coordinator for handling Core Data persistence. A second context is also
 created with the NSMainQueueConcurrencyType that is a child of the primary managed object
 context for doing work on the main queue. Additional child contexts can be created directly
 or via a convenience method interface provided by the store (see newChildManagedObjectContextWithConcurrencyType:).
 
 The managed object context hierarchy is designed to isolate the main thread from disk I/O
 and avoid deadlocks. Because the primary context manages its own private queue, saving the
 main queue context will not result in the objects being saved to the persistent store. The primary
 context must be saved as well for objects to be persisted to disk. 
 
 It is also worth noting that because of the parent/child context hierarchy, objects created on the main 
 thread will not obtain permanent managed object ID's even after the primary context has been saved. 
 If you need to refer to the permanent representations of objects created on the main thread after a save,
 you may ask the main queue context to obtain permanent managed objects for your objects via `obtainPermanentIDsForObjects:error:`. 
 Be warned that when obtaining permanent managed object ID's, you must include all newly created objects 
 that are reachable from the object you are concerned with in the set of objects provided to `obtainPermanentIDsForObjects:error:`.
 This means any newly created object in a one-to-one or one-to-many relationship must be provided or you
 will face a crash from the managed object context. This is due to a bug in Core Data present as of iOS 6
 (see Open Radar http://openradar.appspot.com/11478919).

 @bug Several features require that the managed object model used to initialize the store be mutable so

 initialized via initWithContentsOfURL: return an immutable model. The application developer must send the returned 
 managed object model a mutable copy message to ensure that it is mutable before initializing the managed object store.
 The recommended approach for initializing a managed object store is as follows:
 
    NSURL *modelURL = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:[[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"MyApplication" ofType:@"momd"]];
    // NOTE: Due to an iOS 5 bug, the managed object model returned is immutable.
