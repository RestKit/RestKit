 The name of the attribute on the destination entity that acts as the primary key for instances
 of the entity in the remote backend system. Used to uniquely identify objects within the store
 so that existing objects are updated rather than creating new ones.

 @warning Note that primaryKeyAttribute defaults to the primaryKeyAttribute configured
 on the NSEntityDescription for the entity targetted by the receiving mapping. This provides
 flexibility in cases where a single entity is the target of many mappings with differing
 primary key definitions.

 If the `primaryKeyAttribute` is set on an `RKEntityMapping` that targets an entity with a
 nil primaryKeyAttribute, then the primaryKeyAttribute will be set on the entity as well for
 convenience and backwards compatibility. This may change in the future.
