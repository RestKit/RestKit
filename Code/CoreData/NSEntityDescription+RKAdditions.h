/**
 The name of the attribute that acts as the primary key for the receiver.

 The primary key attribute can be configured in two ways:
    1. From within the Xcode Core Data editing view by
 adding the desired attribute's name as the value for the
 key `primaryKeyAttribute` to the user info dictionary.
    1. Programmatically, by retrieving the NSEntityDescription instance and
 setting the property's value.

 Configuring the primary key attribute programmatically is a convenience interface
 for directly manipulating the user info dictionary of the receiver. As such, the entity
 **must** exist within a mutable managed object model. By default, models are returned in
 an immutable state and must be sent the mutableCopy message to retrieve an mutable copy. Managed
 object models are rendered immutable once used to create a persistent store coordinator, therefore
 the developer **must** configure primary key attributes programmatically before creating a PSC during
 Core Data initialization.

 **NOTE**: This method considers the type of the receiver's primary key attribute when constructing
 the predicate. It will coerce the given value into either an NSString or an NSNumber as
 appropriate. This behavior is a convenience to avoid annoying issues related to Core Data's
 handling of predicates for NSString and NSNumber types that were not appropriately casted.
