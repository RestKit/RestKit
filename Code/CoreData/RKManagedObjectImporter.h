/**
 Instances of RKManagedObjectImporter perform bulk imports of managed objects into a persistent store from
 source files (typically in JSON or XML format) using object mappings. The importer provides functionality
 for updating an existing persistent store or creating a seed database that can be used to bootstrap a new
 persistent store with an initial data set.

 The importer requires that the source files have a MIME type that is identifiable by file extension and be
 parsable using a parser registered with the shared parser registry.
