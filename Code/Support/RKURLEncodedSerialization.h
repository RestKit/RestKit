/**
 The `RKURLEncodedSerialization` class conforms to the `RKSerialization` protocol and provides support for the serialization and deserialization of URL encoded data. URL encoding is used to replace certain characters in a string with equivalent percent escape sequences. The list of characters replaced by the implementation are designed as illegal URL characters by RFC 3986. URL encoded data is used for the submission of HTML forms with the MIME Type `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

/**
 Creates and returns a new `NSDictionary` object from the given URL-encoded string, using the specified encoding.
 
 The dictionary is constructed by splitting the string into components using the `&` character as the delimiter. The results array of strings is then split again using the `=` character as the delimiter. Each resulting key and value delimited by the `=` character is then URL decoded and added a resulting dictionary. The process is across the entire string. Any extraneous `=` characters not delimiting a key and value are ignored. The corresponding values for any keys that appear multiple times within the string be coalesced into an `NSArray` of values.
 
 @param URLEncodedString A URL-encoded string that is to be parsed into an `NSDictionary`.
 @param encoding The encoding to use when URL-decoding the components of the given string. If you are uncertain of the correct encoding, you should use UTF-8 (NSUTF8StringEncoding), which is the encoding designated by RFC 3986 as the correct encoding for use in URLs.
