/**
 An RKTestResponseLoader object provides testing support for asynchronously loading an RKRequest or
 RKObjectLoader object while blocking the execution of the current thread by spinning the run loop.
 This enables a straight-forward unit testing workflow for asynchronous network operations.

 RKTestResponseLoader instances are designed to act as as the delegate for an RKObjectLoader or RKRequest
 object under test. Once assigned as the delegate to a request and the request has been sent,
 waitForResponse: is invoked to block execution until the response is loaded.
