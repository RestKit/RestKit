## Issues

GitHub Issues is for reporting bugs in RestKit and discussing changes to RestKit itself. Please check the [documentation](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/RestKit/), [wiki](https://github.com/RestKit/RestKit/wiki), and [existing issues](https://github.com/RestKit/RestKit/issues?state=closed) before opening a new issue.

Additionaly, please do not post general usage questions to Issues, but instead take them to [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/restkit).

## Pull Requests

Please open up pull requests for any bug fixes you have to RestKit, along with the appropriate test coverage. For larger changes, please open up an issue so we can discuss them.

In general, there is a huge delta in how quickly a pull request is merged depending on if it includes test coverage. Otherwise we have to write it. Beyond that, just keeping things nice and atomic is the only other major point.

Extensive feature work should be discussed with us directly via an issue or email before a ton of engineering effort is expended.
